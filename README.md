# Unit-01-html-css-and-git-homework-portfolio

This is a simple Portfolio page created with basic HTML and CSS.  Consist of 3 link HTML pages that I attempted to format
as close as the instructions given.

This project was created to put in place the recent knowledge aquired on html, css, positioning etc. to continue improving the skills. 

Any comments and advice how to improve ths project will be greatly appreciated.
